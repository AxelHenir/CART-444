        <h1>Typography</h1>
        
        <p>
            Organization is when everything I need is within reach.
            I like having an ordered workspace because it helps me think clearer.
            Being able to oganize a collection and have it look and feel organized to other people is my goal.
            To do this, I use boxes.
            Boxes have content, boundaries and a label. 

            Content is self-explanatory, it's simply what's in the box. 
            Content will inform on the shape, weight and size of the metaphorical box. 
            
            The boundary is the line which separates the content from the non-content.
            The boundary has the resolute and important job of distinguishing that which belongs to the collection.

            The label is a window into the box.
            The label will allow us to know what's inside without having to open the box.
